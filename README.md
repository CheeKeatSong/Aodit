# Aodit
This project was created for i-MSC Lab Startup Competition 2016.

My team has created an android application - Aodit based on gamification concept to assist users to keep track their daily expenses in order to attain efficient personal financial management. But how? this application will take a snapshot of your receipt and record the amount based on daily, weekly, monthly or even yearly. With all those data, Aodit will compute a statistic to visualize the big picture. Also, user get in game currency from scanning receipt can let them exchange dining coupon to save even more!
